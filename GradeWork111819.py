# Print -20 to and including 50. Use any loop you want.

#     Exercise 2:
#
# Create a loop that prints even numbers from 0 to and including 20.
# def number2():
#     for num in range(21):
#         if num %2 ==0:

# Exercise 3:
#
# Prompt the user for 3 numbers. Then print the 3 numbers along with their average after the 3rd number is entered.
# Refer to example below replacing NUMBER1, NUMBER2, NUMBER3, and THEAVERAGE with the actual values.
